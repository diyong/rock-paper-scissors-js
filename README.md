Project to create a rock-paper-scissors game using JavaScript

In this project, I created a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript. During this project, I solidified my understanding of variables and their scope, the use of functions, while loops, if/else statements, and labels/breaks.  

I have also used iterations/increments to keep track of scores and number of rounds. I also made sure to have the functions check user inputs to see if the inputs are valid. Through this project, I have deepened my understanding of how each component can and will work with each other.
